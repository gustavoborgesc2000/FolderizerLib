<h2>What is Folderizer?</h2>

This library provides means to dynamically organize a computer's directory. For now, FolderizerLib will only provide a <em>"folderizer"</em> for audio directories.

It is supposed to work as following:

You may have a directory full of audio files, which you would like to have them organized in a specific folder structure. But there are thousands of files. You can't do it manually. There's where FolderizerLib burst onto the scene. 

You tell it the desired folder structure and it mounts and put your files in order. For example:

<b>\YEAR\ARTIST\ALBUM\ Files here</b>
                    
Or you may want....
                    
<b>\GENRE\ALBUM\ Files here</b>

Or simply..

<b>\ARTIST\ALBUM\ Files Here</b>

Or..

<b>\ALBUM\ Files Here</b>

The bottom line is: whatever is the organization sequence, Folderizer will make it for you.

Later on, it is intended to be built a WPF desktop application that will consume this library and provide a graphic user interface.
